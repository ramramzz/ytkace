## Compatibility

- **iOS:** 15.0 and newer (tweak packages); the prebuilt IPAs follow their YouTube base
- **Architecture:** arm64
- **YTKACE:** 1.0.1

YouTube 21.38.2 requires iOS 17, so two IPAs are published:

| IPA | YouTube base | iOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `YTKACE_1.0.1_YouTube_iOS16_21.33.6.ipa` | 21.33.6 | 16.0 and newer |
| `YTKACE_1.0.1_YouTube_21.38.2.ipa` | 21.38.2 | 17.0 and newer |

Pick the 21.38.2 build unless you are on iOS 16. Either one installs with TrollStore or a developer-certificate sideloader.

## Install

**Jailbroken.** Add the repository in Sileo, Zebra or Cydia:

```
https://itzzace.github.io/ytkace/
```

Rootless and roothide packages are both published. The repository page also has an
[Add to Sileo](https://itzzace.github.io/ytkace/) button.

**Sideloaded.** Download the IPA for your iOS version from the [latest release](https://github.com/itzzace/ytkace/releases/latest) and install it with TrollStore, AltStore, SideStore or LiveContainer.

## Build

Fork the repository, enable Actions, open the **IPA** workflow and provide a direct link to a decrypted YouTube IPA you are legally allowed to use. The completed workflow provides the injected IPA as an artifact. The **Deb** workflow builds the tweak package.

To build both IPAs in one run, fill in the second URL field as well: the workflow takes an iOS 16 base (21.33.6) and an optional iOS 17+ base (21.38.2), and uploads them as separate artifacts. Leaving the second field empty builds a single IPA.

## Settings

Open the YTKACE tab and tap the gear, or open YouTube Settings and choose YTKACE.
Both pages carry the same options, and the YouTube Settings section has a search bar.

## Privacy

YTKACE has no activation service, analytics, telemetry or updater.

## Notes

The playback fix that shipped after 0.8.0 was taken from another project without credit and has been removed. The current Playback Fix is adapted from Mark02's YTPlaybackFix under the MIT license and is credited in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). If you find anything else that isn't credited, open an issue and it will be credited or removed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — issues and pull requests both help.

For bug reports, include your device, iOS version and YouTube version.

For pull requests, keep each one focused on a single change and match the
surrounding style. Two things worth knowing:

- Hooks are installed by name through the helpers in `Tweak/Runtime/Hooking.h`,
  not a hooking framework, so a missing class or selector fails quietly instead
  of crashing on older YouTube versions.
- New user-facing strings go through `YTKACELocalized` and belong in
  `Resources/YTKACE.bundle/en.lproj/Localizable.strings`. Translations for the
  other 14 languages can follow separately.

Build instructions are above.
